# Certificate Pinning Bypass Project

## Objective
The Certificate Pinning Bypass Project aimed to demonstrate the process of bypassing certificate pinning, a security feature in mobile applications. The project involved developing an Android emulator using Genymotion, enabling USB debugging and Developer Mode, and utilizing various tools and components to achieve the objective.

### Tools and Components Used
- Genymotion for Android emulation.
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge) for device interaction.
- Burp Suite for intercepting and analyzing traffic.
- Frida components installed via pip command.
- Universal Frida script downloaded for dynamic instrumentation.

## Objective
The objective of the project was to bypass certificate pinning, a security mechanism implemented in mobile apps to secure HTTP traffic by validating certificates.

## Explanation
Certificate pinning enhances security by ensuring that only specific certificates are accepted when establishing secure connections. However, it can be bypassed using various tools and techniques. In this project, we leveraged Frida, ADB, and Burp Suite to circumvent certificate pinning, enabling monitoring and manipulation of traffic.

## Outcome
The project successfully demonstrated the tampering of certificate pinning mechanisms in Android applications. By bypassing certificate pinning, we exposed vulnerabilities in Android security measures, highlighting the importance of robust security protocols in mobile app development.

## Significance
This project illustrates the potential security risks associated with mobile applications and emphasizes the need for robust security measures. By understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities like certificate pinning bypass, developers can enhance the security posture of their mobile apps.

## Skills Acquired
- Proficiency in using Frida for dynamic instrumentation.
- Familiarity with Burp Suite for intercepting and analyzing traffic.
- Understanding of ADB commands for interacting with Android devices.
